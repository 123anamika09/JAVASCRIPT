// you often need to pause or delay the execution of code, which is where the concept of "sleep" or "pause" comes in. JavaScript doesn't have a built-in sleep function that blocks execution ., you can achieve a delay using asynchronous programming techniques, specifically with Promises and async/await.





Using Promises for Sleep:

 function sleep(milliseconds) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds);
    });
}


                                                                                  // CODE

                                                                                  async function sleep(millis) {
                                                                await new Promise(resolve=>setTimeout(resolve,millis));
                                                                               }
